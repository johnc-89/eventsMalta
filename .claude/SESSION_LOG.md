# Session Log

Chronological log of meaningful work done across Claude sessions. **Latest entries first.** Each session that makes code/schema/architecture changes should append a new entry. See the update protocol in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — Short title

**What changed:** 1–3 sentences on what was done and why.
**Files touched:** [path/one.ts](path/one.ts), [path/two.tsx](path/two.tsx)
**New tables/migrations:** (if any)
**Notes for future sessions:** (gotchas, follow-ups, things deferred)
```

Keep entries tight. If an entry would be longer than ~10 lines, the work probably warrants its own doc — link to it instead.

## 2026-05-11 — Add Claude context system + Stop hook

**What changed:** Created [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (auto-loaded project map: stack, directories, domain model, roles, conventions, common tasks) and this session log so future sessions have context without re-exploring the codebase. Added a **Stop hook** in [.claude/settings.json](settings.json) that blocks session end if files were modified but `.claude/SESSION_LOG.md` wasn't updated — enforces the update protocol automatically. Discussed an analytics implementation plan (self-hosted Supabase tracking + admin dashboard) — **not yet built**, awaiting go-ahead.
**Files touched:** [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), [.claude/SESSION_LOG.md](SESSION_LOG.md), [.claude/settings.json](settings.json)
**Notes for future sessions:**
- Analytics MVP is queued — see plan in conversation or ask the user. Open decisions: track logged-in users separately? add geo via request headers? show view badges on event cards?
- The Stop hook checks `git status --porcelain` for changes; if any exist and SESSION_LOG.md isn't among them, it forces Claude to keep working until the log is updated. Edge case: if you `git commit` everything (including without updating SESSION_LOG) before stopping, the hook won't catch it (working tree is clean). This is a small known gap.
- To disable temporarily: `/hooks` menu, or remove the `hooks.Stop` block from `.claude/settings.json`.
